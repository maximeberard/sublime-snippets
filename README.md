# Sublime Text Snippets

Bunch of JS, CSS (LESS & SASS), PHP & TWIG snippets

Some of LESS snippets are used for mixins defined in [Roadiz](https://github.com/roadiz/roadiz) [BaseTheme](https://github.com/roadiz/BaseTheme) elements -> [https://github.com/roadiz/BaseTheme/blob/master/static/css/base/elements.less](https://github.com/roadiz/BaseTheme/blob/master/static/css/base/elements.less)

### Setting up your environment vars

In order to use *LICENSES* snippets with your own user data,
you need to define some environment variables such as:

- `$TM_FULLNAME`
- `$TM_EMAIL`
- `$TM_ORGANIZATION_NAME`
- `$TM_YEAR`

To do this, just copy the `Default.tmPreferences.example` file to `Packages/User/Default.tmPreferences`
(http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3852)
and edit it with your own credentials.

Then you will be able to use these variables in your own snippets.
